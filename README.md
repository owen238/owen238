- 👋 Hi, I’m @owen238
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...how to setup github in the browser to use vim keybindings. ChatGPT seems to have lied to me that it was a simple config setting. Either I or it are moronic.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...what kinds of things people should put in lines that ask what you want to collaborate on...so meta, eh?
- 📫 How to reach me ...long arms for sure, unless you are in OR...then short arms like my wife's will do (we call her Rex - Toy Story).
- 😄 Pronouns: Please, oh please do not get me going on the linguistic and cultural phenomenon and absurdity that is preferred pronouns!!!
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...I am to be ignored...and why ever did github ask me to fill out a profile like this. Who actually reads these?
